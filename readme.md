# Blog Examples

This is just a collection of React components I'm using for a blog. They're out here in case anyone else wants to use them as well.

Example | Export
 -- | --
React modal using Context API | `{modal} from './'` or <br/>`{useModal, Provider, Context} from './dist/modal'` or <br/>`useModal from 'dist/modal/hook'`, etc...

See: [http://iws.io/2020/create-bootstrap-modal-in-react](http://iws.io/2020/create-bootstrap-modal-in-react) for an example.
